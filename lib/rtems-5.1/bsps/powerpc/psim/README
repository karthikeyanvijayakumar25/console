Notes
=====
The device tree for this BSP is included with rtems-tools and automated
testing of psim is supported by the RTEMS Tester. See
rtems-tools/tester/rtems/testing/bsps/psim-device-tree for specifics. This
file must be kept in sync with startup/linkcmds and the MMU initialization
in the BSP.

For the multiprocessing tests to run, psim supports an area of UNIX
shared memory and UNIX semaphore mapped into the PowerPC address space.
