P\+O\+S\+IX Message Queues.  


{\ttfamily \#include $<$unistd.\+h$>$}\newline


\subsection{Detailed Description}
P\+O\+S\+IX Message Queues. 

This file contains the definitions related to P\+O\+S\+IX Message Queues.

The structure of the routines is identical to that of P\+O\+S\+IX Message\+\_\+queues to leave the option of having unnamed message queues at a future date. They are currently not part of the P\+O\+S\+IX standard but unnamed message\+\_\+queues are. This is also the reason for the apparently unnecessary tracking of the process\+\_\+shared attribute. \mbox{[}In addition to the fact that it would be trivial to add pshared to the mq\+\_\+attr structure and have process private message queues.\mbox{]}

This code ignores the O\+\_\+\+R\+D\+O\+N\+L\+Y/\+O\+\_\+\+W\+R\+O\+N\+L\+Y/\+O\+\_\+\+R\+D\+WR flag at open time.
