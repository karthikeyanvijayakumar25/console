The R\+TC driver provides the interface to configure and use the R\+TC peripheral.

It manages date, time, and alarms.~\newline
This timer is clocked by the 32k\+Hz system clock, and is not impacted by power management settings (P\+MC). To be accurate, it is better to use an external 32k\+Hz crystal instead of the internal 32k\+Hz RC.~\newline
 It uses B\+CD format, and time can be set in A\+M/\+PM or 24h mode through a configuration bit in the mode register.~\newline
 To update date or time, the user has to follow these few steps \+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Set U\+P\+D\+T\+IM and/or U\+P\+D\+C\+AL bit(s) in R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+CR, 
\item Polling or I\+RQ on the A\+C\+K\+U\+PD bit of R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+CR, 
\item Clear A\+C\+K\+U\+PD bit in R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+S\+C\+CR, 
\item Update Time and/or Calendar values in R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+T\+I\+M\+R/\+R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+C\+A\+LR (B\+CD format), 
\item Clear U\+P\+D\+T\+IM and/or U\+P\+D\+C\+AL bit in R\+T\+C\+\_\+\+CR. 
\end{DoxyItemize}An alarm can be set to happen on month, date, hours, minutes or seconds, by setting the proper \char`\"{}\+Enable\char`\"{} bit of each of these fields in the Time and Calendar registers. This allows a large number of configurations to be available for the user. Alarm occurrence can be detected even by polling or interrupt.

A check of the validity of the date and time format and values written by the user is automatically done. Errors are reported through the Valid Entry Register.

For more accurate information, please look at the R\+TC section of the Datasheet.
