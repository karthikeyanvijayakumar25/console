\subsection{Detailed Description}
This module defines the cache management A\+PI for enabling and disabling L1 data cache, L1 instruction cache, L1 dynamic branch prediction caches, L1 T\+LB cache, and L2 cache in the SoC. As well, many it allows users to perform cache maintenance operations on these caches. This includes the following operations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Invalidate\+: Marks the cache line as being invalid, freeing up the space to cache other data. All A\+P\+Is which enable caches invalidates the memory before being enabling the cache.
\item Clean\+: If the cache line is dirty, it synchronizes the cache line data with the upper level memory system and marks that line as clean. All A\+P\+Is which disable caches cleans the memory before disabling the cache.
\item Purge\+: A term used in this A\+PI as a short form for clean and invalidate. This operation cleans and invalidates a cache line in that order, as a single command to the cache controller.
