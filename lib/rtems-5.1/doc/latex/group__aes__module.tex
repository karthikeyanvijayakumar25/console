The A\+ES driver provides the interface to configure and use the A\+ES peripheral. ~\newline
 The Advanced Encryption Standard (A\+ES) specifies a F\+I\+P\+S-\/approved cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data. The A\+ES algorithm is a symmetric block cipher that can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Encryption converts data to an unintelligible form called ciphertext. Decrypting the ciphertext converts the data back into its original form, called plaintext. The C\+I\+P\+H\+ER bit in the A\+ES Mode Register (A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+MR) allows selection between the encryption and the decryption processes. The A\+ES is capable of using cryptographic keys of 128/192/256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data in blocks of 128 bits. This 128-\/bit/192-\/bit/256-\/bit key is defined in the Key Registers (A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+K\+E\+Y\+W\+Rx) and set by \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a02f0598ac0639f2511693f71a0017ba5}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Write\+Key()}}. The input to the encryption processes of the C\+BC, C\+FB, and O\+FB modes includes, in addition to the plaintext, a 128-\/bit data block called the initialization vector (IV), which must be set with \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a4f27098030fb147824d3a0ec2d257c66}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Set\+Vector()}}. The initialization vector is used in an initial step in the encryption of a message and in the corresponding decryption of the message. The Initialization Vector Registers are also used by the C\+TR mode to set the counter value.

To Enable a A\+ES encryption and decryption,the user has to follow these few steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A software triggered hardware reset of the A\+ES interface is performed by \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a12d287be5336020ea028ac7faa71d36b}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Soft\+Reset()}}. 
\item Configure A\+ES algorithm mode, key mode, start mode and operation mode by \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a028d9abafa464c66b4f8fec4bc4f2908}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Configure()}}.  
\item Input A\+ES data for encryption and decryption with function \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_afb9cf6a62eda11e8ba589f5dda812384}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Set\+Input()}}  
\item Set A\+ES key with function \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a02f0598ac0639f2511693f71a0017ba5}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Write\+Key()}}.  
\item To start the encryption or the decryption process with \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a720cdf5e01d7bebdb2fd35471eaf3e81}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Start()}} 
\item To get the encryption or decryption result by \mbox{\hyperlink{aes_8c_a4547454525b6f4b02390f80d0e821459}{A\+E\+S\+\_\+\+Get\+Output()}}  
\end{DoxyItemize}
