\subsection{Detailed Description}
Thread queue heads. 

Each thread is equipped with spare thread queue heads in case it is not enqueued on a thread queue. The first thread enqueued on a thread queue will give its spare thread queue heads to that thread queue. The threads arriving at the queue will add their thread queue heads to the free chain of the queue heads provided by the first thread enqueued. Once a thread is dequeued it use the free chain to get new spare thread queue heads.

Uses a leading underscore in the structure name to allow forward declarations in standard header files provided by Newlib and G\+CC.

This is the F\+I\+FO discipline list. 

On S\+MP configurations this F\+I\+FO is used to enqueue the per scheduler instance priority queues of this structure. This ensures F\+I\+FO fairness among the highest priority thread of each scheduler instance. \mbox{\Hypertarget{struct__Thread__queue__Heads_a21d754973bc1115a827336f826e2d142}\label{struct__Thread__queue__Heads_a21d754973bc1115a827336f826e2d142}}

This union contains the data structures used to manage the blocked set of tasks which varies based upon the discipline.
