The W\+DT driver provides the interface to configure and use the W\+DT peripheral.

The W\+DT can be used to prevent system lock-\/up if the software becomes trapped in a deadlock. It can generate a general reset or a processor reset only. It is clocked by slow clock divided by 128.

The W\+DT is running at reset with 16 seconds watchdog period (slow clock at 32.\+768 k\+Hz) and external reset generation enabled. The user must either disable it or reprogram it to meet the application requires.

To use the W\+DT, the user could follow these few steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enable watchdog with given mode using \mbox{\hyperlink{wdt_8c_ac9145d17b1cbe9ca58154d330b22d9bf}{W\+D\+T\+\_\+\+Enable()}}. 
\item Restart the watchdog using \mbox{\hyperlink{wdt_8c_a3cd0aea566c94375faa90bc33f530011}{W\+D\+T\+\_\+\+Restart()}} within the watchdog period. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

For more accurate information, please look at the W\+DT section of the Datasheet.
