The R\+TT driver provides the interface to configure and use the R\+TT peripheral.

The Real-\/time Timer is used to count elapsed seconds.~\newline
This timer is clocked by the 32k\+Hz system clock divided by a programmable 16-\/bit value. To be accurate, it is better to use an external 32k\+Hz crystal instead of the internal 32k\+Hz RC.~\newline
 To count elapsed seconds, the user could follow these few steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Programming P\+T\+P\+R\+ES in R\+T\+T\+\_\+\+MR to feeding the timer with a 1Hz signal. 
\item Writing the bit R\+T\+T\+R\+ST in R\+T\+T\+\_\+\+MR to restart the timer with new settings.  
\end{DoxyItemize}

An alarm can be set to happen on second by setting alarm value in R\+T\+T\+\_\+\+AR. Alarm occurrence can be detected by polling or interrupt.

For more accurate information, please look at the R\+TT section of the Datasheet.
