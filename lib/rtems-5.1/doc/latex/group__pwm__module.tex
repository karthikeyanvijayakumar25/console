The P\+WM driver provides the interface to configure and use the P\+WM peripheral.

The P\+WM macrocell controls square output waveforms of 4 channels. Characteristics of output waveforms such as period, duty-\/cycle, dead-\/time can be configured.~\newline
Some of P\+WM channels can be linked together as synchronous channel and duty-\/cycle of synchronous channels can be updated by P\+DC automatically.

Before enabling the channels, they must have been configured first. The main settings include\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Configuration of the clock generator. 
\item Selection of the clock for each channel. 
\item Configuration of output waveform characteristics, such as period, duty-\/cycle etc. 
\item Configuration for synchronous channels if needed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Selection of the synchronous channels.
\item Selection of the moment when the W\+R\+DY flag and the corresponding P\+DC transfer request are set (P\+T\+RM and P\+T\+R\+CS in the P\+W\+M\+\_\+\+S\+CM register).
\item Configuration of the update mode (U\+P\+DM in the P\+W\+M\+\_\+\+S\+CM register).
\item Configuration of the update period (U\+PR in the P\+W\+M\+\_\+\+S\+C\+UP register). 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

After the channels is enabled, the user must use respective update registers to change the wave characteristics to prevent unexpected output waveform. i.\+e. P\+W\+M\+\_\+\+C\+D\+T\+Y\+U\+P\+Dx register should be used if user want to change duty-\/cycle when the channel is enabled.

For more accurate information, please look at the P\+WM section of the Datasheet.
