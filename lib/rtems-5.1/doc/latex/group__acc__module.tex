The A\+CC driver provides the interface to configure and use the A\+CC peripheral.~\newline
 It applies comparison on two inputs and gives a compare output.

To Enable a A\+CC Comparison,the user has to follow these few steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enable A\+CC peripheral clock by setting the corresponding bit in P\+M\+C\+\_\+\+P\+C\+E\+R1 (P\+MC Peripheral Clock Enable Register 1)  
\item Reset the controller by asserting A\+C\+C\+\_\+\+C\+R\+\_\+\+S\+W\+R\+ST in A\+C\+C\+\_\+\+CR(A\+CC Control Register)  
\item Configure the mode as following steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Select inputs for S\+E\+L\+M\+I\+N\+US and S\+E\+L\+P\+L\+US in A\+C\+C\+\_\+\+MR (A\+CC Mode Register).
\item Enable Analog Comparator by setting A\+C\+EN in A\+C\+C\+\_\+\+MR.
\item Configure Edge Type to detect different compare output.  
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Wait until the automatic mask period expires by polling M\+A\+SK bit in A\+C\+C\+\_\+\+I\+SR. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
