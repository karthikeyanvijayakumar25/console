This module defines the interface for the Benchmark Timer Driver.

The following methods in this module must be provided by each B\+SP\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item benchmark\+\_\+timer\+\_\+initialize
\item benchmark\+\_\+timer\+\_\+read
\item benchmark\+\_\+timer\+\_\+disable\+\_\+subtracting\+\_\+average\+\_\+overhead
\end{DoxyItemize}

The units measured are B\+SP specific but should be at the highest granularity possible.

The Benchmark Timer may use the same hardware as the Clock Driver. No R\+T\+E\+MS Timing Tests will use both drivers at the same time.
