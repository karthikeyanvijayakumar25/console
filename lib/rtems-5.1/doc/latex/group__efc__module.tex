The E\+E\+FC driver provides the interface to configure and use the E\+E\+FC peripheral.

The user needs to set the number of wait states depending on the frequency used.~\newline
Configure number of cycles for flash read/write operations in the F\+WS field of E\+E\+F\+C\+\_\+\+F\+MR.

It offers a function to send flash command to E\+E\+FC and waits for the flash to be ready.

To send flash command, the user could do in either of following way\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Write a correct key, command and argument in E\+E\+F\+C\+\_\+\+F\+CR.  
\item Or, Use I\+AP (In Application Programming) function which is executed from R\+OM directly, this allows flash programming to be done by code running in flash. 
\item Once the command is achieved, it can be detected even by polling E\+E\+F\+C\+\_\+\+F\+SR or interrupt. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The command argument could be a page number,G\+P\+N\+VM number or nothing, it depends on the command itself. Some useful functions in this driver could help user translate physical flash address into a page number and vice verse.

For more accurate information, please look at the E\+E\+FC section of the Datasheet.
